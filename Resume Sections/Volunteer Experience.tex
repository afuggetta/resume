% Note that this section is not included in the USAJobs resume builder, but they do encourage inclusion of volunteer experience
% Where to put it - work experience? Additional information? I decided to make my own section with varying formatting, seen below

\section{Volunteer Experience}
  \resumeSubHeadingListStart

    % Copy and paste entries as needed for more entries
    \resumeSubheading
      {Volunteer NCO and Officer}{2021 -- 2024}
      {Ohio Military Reserve}{Middletown, Ohio}
      
  \resumeSubHeadingListEnd
